# Ultrsound-wavelet-denoising
A proposal for the use of wavelet filtering using universal soft thresholding to reduce speckle noise in ultrasound images is presented. Three metrics were considered to evaluate the quality of the images after processing the techniques: root mean square error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM).
